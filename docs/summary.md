# Summary

## Overview of 2-Way Sync

GitHub's 2-way sync feature enables bidirectional synchronization between GitHub repositories and Archbee. Unlike traditional one-way synchronization, which only updates changes from a source to a destination(Github to Archbee), 2-way sync ensures that changes made in both the GitHub repository and Archbee are reflected in each other.

Even though it's a 2-way sync system, we still consider GitHub as the absolute source of truth. We will open a PR, and merging it is up to you. If you merge it, the documents in Archbee will get updated.

Whether you're a developer, project manager, or collaborator, this feature allows you to seamlessly synchronize your GitHub repositories with Archbee, ensuring consistency across your workflows.
